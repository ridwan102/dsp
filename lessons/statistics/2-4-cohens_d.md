[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Exercise 1: For the evening news, the mean and standard deviation summary statistic would have a great impact on the audience and easy to communicate. Per the example for all live births, the mean pregnancy length is 38.6 weeks, the standard deviation is 2.7 weeks, which means we should expect deviations of 2-3 weeks to be common.

To reassure a patient, the effect size would be the most appropriate. If a mother is concerned with the length of their pregnancy, per the the example, mean pregnancy length for first babies is 38.601; for other babies it is 38.523. The difference is 0.078 weeks, which works out to 13 hours. As a fraction of the typical pregnancy length, this difference is about 0.2%. The 0.2% would help reassure that everything is okay. 

A typical pregnancy is 39 weeks long; first babies on average arrive at 38.601 weeks. Based on that summary statistic, they actually arrive a little early. However, the difference is 0.399 weeks which is about 1% as a fraction of the typical pregnancy length.
